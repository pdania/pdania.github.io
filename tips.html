        <li><h3>Take initiative.</h3>
            <p>“When you’re talking or texting while planning the date, as the guy always have a time and place in mind.
                You never want to get into one of those exchanges like… ‘What do you want to do? Oh I don’t know, what
                do you want to do?’ Be confident and make a recommendation.” – Radio Wright, Online Dating Expert</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Be personable. </h3>
            <p>“Don’t email or text to ask a woman out for the first time. The latter are impersonal, and dating is all
                about getting to know someone personally. It also sets a poor tone for the relationship’s communication
                dynamics.” – Erika Martinez, Psy.D. Licensed Psychologist</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Don’t move too fast.</h3>
            <p>“For most women, online dating involves a certain level of risk and anxiety so spend time getting to know
                her online and through phone and video chats before suggesting meeting in person to ensure she feels
                comfortable.” – Dr. Wyatt Fisher, Clinical Psychologist</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3>Go somewhere you’re comfortable.</h3>
            <p>You might think that you’re being a gentleman by letting your date decide where you go on your date, but
                women like to see that you can take control. Help cut through any nerves by arranging to meet up in
                familiar territory that will help you feel more comfortable.” – Nicolas Aujula, Relationship Coach and
                Therapist</p></li>
        <li>
            <h3>Look your best.</h3>
            <p>“A lot of guys don’t think about how they look before going on dates, even though women pay attention to
                the little details related to appearance. Make sure you are well-groomed (check for dirty fingernails,
                freshly apply deodorant, shower). Second, make sure your clothes match, aren’t wrinkled, and look decent
                on you.” –David Bennett, Dating Coach at The Popular Man</p>

    <ol>
        <li><p>Do what feels right for you.</p></li>
        <li><p>Don’t be so quick to judge, there are a lot of choices out there especially with a dating site. And if
            you judge someone negatively after the first lull in a conversation, you may just be passing up Mr.
            Right.</p></li>
        <li><p>Any pictures you post, especially your main photo, shouldn’t hide your face or body. Be proud of you.
            Show yourself. Post pictures of you!</p></li>
        <li><p>If you’re viewing someone several times a day/week, don’t be afraid to say something. You might lose out
            by remaining silent, because we’re not sure if you’re really interested, or just passing by.</p></li>
        <li><p>Don’t rush things, of course. Though we’re all looking for a special someone, it’s more fun when you
            don’t try looking but rather stumble right onto it. I know it’s ironic that I’m saying this about a dating
            site, but I’m really just looking for a good conversation before anything else.</p></li>
        <li><p>“If all a guy can start off with is hi, don’t blow him off because he’s not blowing your mind with the
            most amazing greeting you’ve ever read. Give him a little patience and a moment to open up. You could be
            ignoring someone that just needs a moment to get the pleasantries out of the way.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Many of the things you look for in a relationship, a man is looking for as well. Things that you like,
            men like: compliments, engaging conversation, eye-contact, all of it.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Spend some time trying to get to know someone by asking questions about him. In our culture a lot of
            people make quick judgements and move on without truly getting to know someone.”</p></li>
        <li><p>“Don’t put in your profile that you want ‘to be treated like a princess,’ that you are ‘high maintenance
            but worth it,’ or that you ‘want to be spoiled.’ It can come across as selfish instead of confident.”</p>
